First you must compile Xound: /!\ WARNING: You need the libtag1-dev, libtag-extras1 and libphonon-dev packages to compile Xound and its plugins /!\

Just type in a terminal, in the root directory of Xound:
    qmake
    make

And then to install Xound type
    sudo make install

If you want to compile plugins, cd to  plugins/TheNameOfThePlugin (for example: plugins/Lyrics) , and type:
    qmake
    make

If you want to install plugins, it's also simple, in the directory of the plugin type:
    sudo make install

And then run Xound with:
    xound
 and enjoy! :)


			 Thank you to use Xound,
